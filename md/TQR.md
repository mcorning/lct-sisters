# TQR Loyalty System

## OBX (Out of Box Experience)

1) A Sponsor sends a promotion
2) All Customers see the promo in a Promo dialog on the Customer vue.
3) Customer clicks a `Subscribe` button to add the Sponsor to the Customer's Sponsor treeview control.
4) Selecting a Sponsor from that treeview lists the current Promos for the selected Sponsor
5) The next time a Sponsor sends a promo, the listed promos shows it automatically
6) Otherwise, go to Step 2

## Later UX

1) The Sponsor treeview has a `See all Sponsors` checkbox.
2) Checking to box lists all Subscribers and their current promotions
3) Selecting a Sponsor from the list does the same thing as Step 2 above.
