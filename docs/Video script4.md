# A COVID Early Warning System

This is the fourth installment of our story of Seth, a physical therapist in Sisters, OR who uses software to keep his patients safe from the ravages of COVID-19.

Previously...we saw Seth show Katy how to fix Google mistakes and how to warn others if shet tests positive for COVID.

In this episode, Seth shows Katy how to integrate public health into her personal life...

## EPISODE 4: Sharing is caring

By now, Katy knows the drill. First, PT. Then another lesson in armchair epidemiology.

### Page 1:

"So how did you do at cards the other day, Katy?"

"Actually, I won both games."

"Yeah, but you haven't played against me, now have you? Today you will learn how to invite other players to your game in a way that keeps all players safe. Open your app, please."

Katy presses the LCT button on her home screen.

"Now click on the Fika map marker and press `Mark Calendar`. This time, we are going to move the event to the future, and you are going to send me a link so I can add it to my calendar for next week, as well."

"To edit a calendar event, click it and you see an area at the bottom of the calendar that lets you do things. We are going to edit the datetime, so click the edit icon on the right."

### To be continued

Seth's closing remarks to Katy are, "Next time I'll show you how you can invite me to your Thursday card games..."

As Katy leaves, Seth says,"Until then, Katy, stay safe out there..."
