This is the second installment of our story of Seth, a physical therapist in Sisters, OR who uses software to keep his patients safe from the ravages of COVID-19.

Last time we saw Seth show Katy how to share a tool Seth believes can help the residents of Sisters minimize the impact of the virus on their health and the city's economy.

In this episode, Seth shows Katy what happens with rubber meets the road...

EPISODE 3: IT COULD BE WORSE

By now, Katy knows the drill. First, PT. Then another lesson in armchair epidemiology.

"Ok, Katy, today I'll show you how the app not only keeps us safe, but how it can help Google as well.
"I'm using that old Galaxy again here. As you did when searched for Fika last week, since i don't see Step and Spine listed on the map, I will search for it's location."

Seth types in the search box.

"Good, we are at the top of the list...oops, wrong location. Google maps is wrong. But the app can handle this. I select the marker where it is (in the middle of the grocery store).
"Then i drag it over here where we are.
"Now the next time i open the app, our map marker will be in the correct location."

To illustrate how exposure alerts work, Seth says,
"You already scanned in today. We share the same space at the same time, so I will add an event to my calendar that is fairly close in time to your event on your calendar."

Seth clicks the MARK CALENDAR button






Seth's closing remarks to Katy are, "Next time I'll show you how you can invite me to your Thursday card games..."


As Katy leaves, Seth says,"Until then, Katy, stay safe out there..."
