This is the story of Seth, a physical therapist in Sisters, OR who uses software to keep his patients safe from the ravages of COVID-19.

## EPISODE 1: The beginning of the end

In this first episode, Seth shows Katy the app he uses with his patients to help crush the virus in their fair city.

### Page 1: A Word to the Wise and otherwise

Katy is a new patient at Seth's clinic. As Seth starts to take Katy through the conventional intake meeting, Seth points to a QR code on the counter. "Ok, Katy, before we get going, please use your phone to scan this QR Code."

Katy turns on her camera, points the the card on the counter, and sees an app open on her phone. The app shows a calendar with her 45 minute intake meeting entered. "What's this?" Katy asks.

"This is our CoVid Early Warning System. Each time you visit the clinic and scan the code you add data to your phone that will help us all crush the virus in this zip code.

See that button at the bottom of the screen? Click it and the app will be on your home screen and just a click away.

anyway, this early warning system means that if anybody in this clinic (patients or staff) tests positive, we will send an exposure warning instantly to everybody who uses the app.

"If you were in the clinic after that warning date, you will see an exposure alert on your phone the next time you open the app.

"This alert is your signal to get tested.

If you, too, are positive, you send your own exposure warning, and everybody who uses this app who shared space with you for fifteens minutes gets alerted, as well."

"Wow, that's brilliant, Seth. Well done," Katy smiled.

"Thanks, Katy. Oh and you will see these QR cards all over the clinic. So scan a card each time you come back to us.

"And congratulations, you have taken the first critical step to making us all safe in Sisters.

"Now, let's get started on your physical therapy. How's the back been lately?..."
