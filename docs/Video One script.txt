Katy's phone opens her new calendar and sees the 45 minute intake meeting is already entered.

Seth says, "Next time you come in, scan this QR again to record your session.

As the meeting ends, Katy says she's going to stop for a coffee at Fika on her way home.

Seth says, "Hold up a second...Click the Space button at the bottom of the screen...good...now, type "Fika" in the search box at the top of the screen.

"When you get to the coffee shop, click the Mark Calendar button to record your visit using the current time when you enter the shop.
