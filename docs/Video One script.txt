This is the second installment of our story of Seth, a physical therapist in Sisters, OR who uses software to keep his patients safe from the ravages of COVID-19.

SHARING IS CARING
Last time we saw Seth introduce Katy to a tool Seth believes can help the residents of Sisters minimize the impact of the virus on their health and on the city's economy.

As Seth takes Katy's temperature, he watches Katy scan the clinic's QR code and says, "Good job. When we're done today, I'll show you how you can share the app with your friends and family. 
"Then we can talk more about "crush the virus" lottery."


As Katy cools down after the workout she says, "Ok, show me this lottery thingy."

Seth tells her to open the app. "See that QR code icon in the upper left corner of the screen?" "Yeah." "Click it."

Katy's phone shows a QR code. This time, the only data in the code is Katy's userID. 

Seth explains, "That random string at the end of the Event Link is the only thing the app needs to be able to alert you later if you get exposed to the virus.
"Now, next time you are with somebody who wants to crush the virus too, have them scan this QR. Here, let's try it now so you can see what happens."

Seth scans the code and notes the messages that appear on each phone.

"I can see that the system is rewarding you for sharing the app, and it suggests i do the same thing so i can enter the lottery.
"You see the confirmation number that tells you that your chance of winning just went up."

Katy smiles. "Cool."

Seth says, "Sharing this app is vital to its success and to our collective safety. Plus, the more your share the app, the more likely you are to win the lottery."

Katy, "Ok. I'll tell my girlfriends at cards on Thursday. We meet at Fika twice a month. This will help make Fika a safer place in town as well, won't it?"

"If we all use it all the time, yes. If we don't use it and don't share it, we are no better off than we were last year.
"On Thursday I'll show you how the app works on that day when you get perhaps the worst news of your life..."




As Katy leaves, Seth says,"Until then, Katy, stay safe out there..."
