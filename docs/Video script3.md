# A COVID Early Warning System

This is the third installment of our story of Seth, a physical therapist in Sisters, OR who uses software to keep his patients safe from the ravages of COVID-19.

Previously...we saw Seth show Katy how to share a tool Seth believes can help the residents of Sisters minimize the impact of the virus on their health and their city's economy.

In this episode, Seth shows Katy what happens when the rubber meets the road...

## EPISODE 3: IT COULD BE WORSE

By now, Katy knows the drill. First, PT. Then another lesson in armchair epidemiology.

### Page 1: WHERE IN THE WORLD

"Ok, Katy, today I'll show you how the app keeps us safe.
"But first, we need to take a little detour because Google doesn't know which building we are in.
"So, open the app, please."

Katy clicks the app's icon on her phone's Home screen.

Seth says, "The app opens on the map. Now scroll the map to the intersection of Highway 20 and W Barclay Drive."

Katy uses her finger to northwest on the map until she finds the intesection.

"You see familiar landmarks here, yeah?"

Katy nods and adds, "But where is `Step and Spine`?

"That's the problem. Actually there are two problems. First, our clinic is too small in Google's eyes to justify a marker on the map. Fine.
But here's a bigger problem: start typing 'step' in the map search box"

By the time Katy finishes the word, 'Step and Spine' appears at the top of the list.

"I see us." Katy touches the entry, and the map zooms to a new marker on the map. "What's this? we aren't in the middle of the grocery store!'

"That's OK. the app can handle this," Seth says.
"Touch the marker...then drag it over here where we are, the grey box next to Sisters Inn and Suites.
"Now, the next time you open the app, our map marker will be in the correct location.
"Right, let's get to the good stuff."

### Page 3: The BRB

"Today, Katy, I will introduce you to the crux of the app. We are going to talk about the third primary button on the app, the `Big Red Button`.

"Imagine you get home today and your neighbor tells you her husband isn't feeling well.
"So you grab your inhome COVID test kit (you have one, right?), and sure enough, you, too are positive.
"First thing you do is call you Primary Care Physician and get a prescription for that new anti-viral theraputic the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization.
"As soon as you get off the phone with the doctor, you open your app...

"Ready? click that `Big Red Button`."

Katy clicks the BRB on her app and opens the `Exposure` view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Page 4: What's in it for you?

"For today," Seth begins, "ignore the details on this page. The only thing we do here is choose the kind of warning we send to the server."

Seth directs Katy's attention to the bottom of the screen.

"Click the `DRILL` button".

She clicks, and sees a Confirmation that the server can alert some number of people.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Page 5: What's in it from me?

"Since we both have an entry in our calendars," Seth says, "I should see an `Exposure Alert` when I open my app."

Seth opens his app and they see a large green banner on Seth's app.

"Since you pressed the `DRILL` button, my alert is green and its message is: DO NOT ACT."

Katy nods, "OK"

If this had been a real alert, I would get tested, and if positive, I would hit the BRB. And so it goes until we've crushed the virus in our fair city."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Rest of the Story

Seth takes a breath, lets Katy catch up with the information and says,
"When a test or physician diagnoses you with COVID, you are having a bad day. But it could be much worse.

There could be dozens of people infected the same way you were, but they don't know it yet.

> Today, for example, in our little zip code of 7,000 residents, COVID infection when up by 19 cases. That's an increase from 825/10,000 to 850/10,000.

Armed with the app, as soon as you know you're exposed, everybody you shared space and time with knows there's a good chance they are carrying the virus, too.

So if, as a group, we all get tested on the same day of our alert, we have deprived the virus of up to two weeks to replicate and mutate.

Without the app, time is now our ally.

With it, time is not an ally for the viruses. Frankly, the virus hasn't got a chance in our town.

### To be continued

Seth's closing remarks to Katy are, "Next time I'll show you how you can invite me to your Thursday card games..."

As Katy leaves, Seth says,"Until then, Katy, stay safe out there..."
